Your vision is sharpest in the central part of the retina, an area called the fovea.
This area contains a high density of light-sensing photoreceptors, in this case the
color-sensing cone cells. The center-to-center spacing of these cells is approximately
3m. If the image of the laser pointer spot in Example 19.17 is centered on one
cone cell, then the edge of the central maximum—the first dark fringe—is at the
center of the next cone cell, as shown in FiGuRE 19.28, This makes sense; we'd expect
the size of the central maximum to closely match the spacing of the cone cells, Pack-
ing the cone cells any tighter wouldn't increase visual acuity, and packing them less
tightly wouldn't take full advantage of the possible resolution of the eye. Increasing
the pupil size doesn’t improve resolution, because this increases the importance of
aberrations, For pupil sizes larger than a few mm, resolution of the eye isn’t limited
by diffraction—it is limited by aberrations.

The fact that light is focused to a small spot, not a perfect point, has important
consequences for how well a telescope can resolve two stars separated by only a
small angle in the sky. F1GURE 12.29» shows how two nearby stars would appear in a
telescope. Instead of perfect points, they appear as two diffraction images. Nonetheless,
because they're clearly two separate stars, we say they are resolved. FIGURE 19.29 shows two
Sars that are closer together. Here the two diffraction pattems overlap, and it is becoming
difficult to see them as two independent stars: They are barely resolved. The two very
nearby stars in FIGURE 19.28 are so close together that we can’t resolve them at all.

How close can the two diffraction patterns be before we can no longer resolve
them? One of the major scientists of the 19th century, Lord Rayleigh, studied this
problem and suggested a reasonable rule that today is called Rayleigh’s criterion. In
Figure 19.29b, where the two stars are just resolved, the central maximum of the dif-
fraction pattern of one star lies on top of the first dark fringe of the diffraction pat-
tem of the other star. Because the angle between the central maximum and the first
dark fringe is ,, the centers of the two stars are separated by angle 6, = 1.22A/D.
Thus Rayleigh’s criterion is:

Two objects are resolvable if they are separated by an angle @ that is greater than

6; = 1,22A/D. If their angular separation is less than 6, then they are not

resolvable. If their separation is equal to @,, then they are just barely resolvable.

For telescopes, the angle 6; = 1.22A/D is called the angular resolution of the
telescope. The angular resolution depends only on the lens diameter and the wave-

The Environmental Movement
Thecnvironmental movement provides a good example
‘ofhow a social movement gives rise to interest groups
formed from reliance on purposive incentives. In the
1890s, as a result of the emergence of conservation as
‘a major issue, the Sierra Club was organized. In the
1930s, conservation once again became popular, and
the Wilderness Society and the National Wildlife Fed-
eon wre cated. Inthe 1960s and 1970s envio
mental issues again had high public inerest, and we saw
themergene ofthe Environmental Defense Fund and
Environmental Action.

Exvironmental activists have recently been particu-

produftion, particularly with respect to proposed pipe-
lines th transport this oil and nacural gas.

Te Dakota Access Pipeline project, which would
